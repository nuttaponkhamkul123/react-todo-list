# React To-Do List

---

This project is an experimental endeavor to **rebuild an existing to-do list application, originally developed in Angular, using React**. It serves as a practical exercise in understanding and applying the fundamental concepts of React, particularly for developers familiar with other front-end frameworks like Angular.

## Project Goals

* **Gain hands-on experience with React:** Transitioning from Angular to React provides a valuable opportunity to learn React's component-based architecture, JSX, state management, and lifecycle methods.
* **Compare and contrast Angular and React paradigms:** This project allows for a direct comparison of how similar functionalities are implemented in both frameworks, highlighting their respective strengths and approaches.
* **Develop a functional to-do list application:** The core objective is to create a fully functional to-do list that allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete.

## Key Features (Planned/Implemented)

* **Add New Tasks:** Users can input and add new tasks to the list.
* **Mark Tasks as Complete:** Tasks can be toggled as complete or incomplete.
* **Delete Tasks:** Users can remove tasks from the list.
* **Persistence (Optional Future Enhancement):** Explore options for saving and loading tasks (e.g., Local Storage, a simple backend API).

## Technologies Used

* **React:** The core JavaScript library for building the user interface.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For application logic.
* **HTML5:** For structuring the content.
* **CSS3:** For styling the application.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd [project-folder-name]
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

This will typically open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Enhancements

* Implement **task editing** functionality.
* Add **filtering options** (e.g., show all, active, completed tasks).
* Integrate with **local storage** for basic data persistence.
* Explore using a **state management library** like Redux or Zustand for more complex state needs.
